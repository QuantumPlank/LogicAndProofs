Profs play a central role in mathematics, and deductive reasoning is the foundation on which proofs are based.

We arrive at a \textit{conclusion} from the assumption that some other statements, called \textit{premises}, are true.

We will say that an argument is \textit{valid} if the premises cannot all be true without the conclusion being true as well. And is \textit{invalid} otherwise.

\textit{Connective symbols} are symbols used to combine statements to form more complex statements.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c | c}
        Symbol & Meaning \\
        $\lor$ & or \\
        $\land$ & and \\
        $\lnot$ & not \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}


The statement $P \lor Q$ is called the disjunction of $P$ and $Q$, the statement $P \land Q$ is called the conjunction of $P$ and $Q$, and $\lnot P$ is called the negation of $P$.
